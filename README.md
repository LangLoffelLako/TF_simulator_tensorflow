## Introduction

The Tensorflow Transformer Simulation is a project developed by Luis Mienhardt. The goal of this project is to design a simulation to elucidate the transformer architecture for professionals in the field of Information Systems and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (Mittelständische Unternehmen). The simulation is aimed to provide an understanding of why certain design decisions were made for transformer models.

### Binder

You can access the application via [Binder](https://mybinder.org) through these badges.

The first badge gives you access to the jupyter notebook directly (you will be able to see all the code necessary to run the application)

The second batch runs the jupyter notebook as a voila application for you, such that you are able to see the interactive content without any code interferring with your experience.
