## Introduction
The Tensorflow Transformer Simulation is a project developed by Luis Mienhardt. The goal of this project is to design a simulation to elucidate the transformer architecture for professionals in the field of Information Systems and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (Mittelständische Unternehmen). The simulation is aimed to provide an understanding of why certain design decisions were made for transformer models.
